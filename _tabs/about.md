> I’m**`Yazan Saleh`**, a Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR) practitioner supporting public sector organizations. I recently began studying Red Team techniques to deepen my DFIR expertise rather than focusing solely on Blue Team certifications. Here I document and demonstrate my learnings to advance my skills  starting with Red Team Active Directory attacks, then forensic analysis of those attacks, followed by malware analysis.
On the incident response side, I’m expanding my experience with firewalls (Palo Alto, FortiGate) and specializing in ransomware incident response. I also have hands‑on experience as a CTF competitor and lab creator, and I currently serve as an Advisory Council member.
